# CCAPDEV-LabReservation
**CCAPDEV Major Course Output: Lab Reservation System**

Please open with a live server, preferably Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" addon.
All files prefixed with a "temp" will be removed with MCO2's backend implementation.
The design of the main "reserve" page is still currently temporary, as we plan to spruce up its design in MCO2.
If there are any problems, please don't hesitate to contact anyone from our group.

# CCAPDEV-LabReservation
**CCAPDEV Major Course Output: Lab Reservation System**

A Computer Laboratory Reservation System web application made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for students and faculty to schedule and manage their computer lab usage.


## How to Run
1. Download the files and place them in the same folder.
2. Open the files in VSCode.
3. Download the extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.
4. Open index.html still within VSCode
5. Right-click on the code window of index.html and find the "Open with Live Server" button to start running the website

Note:
It is recommended to use Google Chrome to open this website. If opening the files automatically goes to another browser, 
you may want to copy the url and open it on chrome.

All files prefixed with a "temp" will be removed with MCO2's backend implementation.
The design of the main "reserve" page is still currently temporary, as we plan to spruce up its design in MCO2.<br>
If there are any problems, please don't hesitate to contact anyone from our group.

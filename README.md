# CCAPDEV-LabReservation
**CCAPDEV Major Course Output: Lab Reservation System**

A Computer Laboratory Reservation System web application made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for students and faculty to schedule and manage their computer lab usage.


## How to Run
1. Download the files and place them in the same folder.
2. // don't run this in chrome.

Note:
It is recommended to use Google Chrome to open this website. If opening the files automatically goes to another browser, 
you may want to copy the url and open it on chrome.

All files prefixed with a "temp" will be removed with MCO2's backend implementation.
The design of the main "reserve" page is still currently temporary, as we plan to spruce up its design in MCO2.<br>
If there are any problems, please don't hesitate to contact anyone from our group.
